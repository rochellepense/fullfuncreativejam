<h2>Shilling</h2>
<div>With Shilling being one of the older builidings on campus, it's no surprise that many of the stories take place there. This first story is probably one of the more imfamous ones as many people have heard the story of "Rail Girl". It is rumored that this ghost is of a girl who tragically died in the theatre and has to be offered candy before a show otherwise everything will go wrong. </div>
<div>Have you ever noticed some bricked up windows above Einstin's on the backside of Shilling? Supposedly, this is a sign of respect to a professor that died in their office decades ago when a fire broke out. People have reported having strange feelings and seeing things around the walled up portion of the building.</div>
<h2>Aston</h2>
<div>One ghost story that has been around for nearly a decade is that of the ghost that haunts Aston Hall. Apparently, in 1927 a girl named Bernice Richardson committed suicide by ingesting carbolic acid because her poor grades prevented her from rushing a sorority. According to several articles, it is rumored that she still haunts the thrid floor, however, people have claimed to see her all over the building. Reports of her include seeing her in a upper window from down below, objects being moved, and disappearing around a corner never to be found.</div>
<h2>The Old Gym</h2>
<div>It's time to pay our respects to the Old Gym. Since being torn down almost a year ago, let's go over some of it's more horrifying stories. Seeing as it used to be one of the oldest, if not the oldest building on campus before it's demise, the Department of Theatre and Dance used the space as storage and rehearsal space. People have reported strange noises coming from the building that include but are not limited to hearing the sounds of past games, basketball dribbles, scoreboard sounds, cheers, and runners' footsteps all coming from the lofted track.</div>
<h2>The RTUC</h2>
<div>Alternatively, the building that replaced the Old Gym, the Center for Theatre and Dance, used to house a much older building. The RTUC, I can't remember what it stands for, was basically the University Commons before the UC. It has been reported that in the lower level of that building, more specifically in the boiler room behind the steps, a murderer would use the boilers as a place to hid bodies.</div>
